kata starter
================

This is a repo that can easily be used to start a code kata.

##### Included is:

- rsepc
- guard (with growl notifications)
- pry

#### To setup

```
$ git clone <repo>
$ cd <directory>
$ bundle install
```

if you would like guard to run as you are coding:

```
$ bundle exec guard
```
it will auto run the rsepc test when a a test is edited or created as well
if your code is changed.
